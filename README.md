# HNanoSolver
> This is a project used to learn Fluid Dynamics and GPU acceleration through Cuda.
- **HNanoSolver**, All in one node computing a quantity advection by a divergence free velocity field on the GPU.
- **HNanoProjectNonDivergent**, Compute a Divergence free velocity field on the GPU.
- **HNanoAdvect**, Advect any float fields on the GPU.
- **HNanoAdvectVelocity**, Advect any vector field on the GPU.
- **HNanoViewer**, Standalone app to visualize VDBs and kernels without having to relaunch Houdini.



# Warning ! 
> Very Early Development 

This repo is undergoing rewrite very often and might not compile from time to time.
